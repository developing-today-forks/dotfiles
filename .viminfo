	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			     Lesson 2.5: USING A COUNT TO DELETE MORE
	
	
	   ** Typing a number with an operator repeats it that many times. **
	
	  In the combination of the delete operator and a motion mentioned above you
	  insert a count before the motion to delete more:
		 d   number   motion
	
	  1. Move the cursor to the first UPPER CASE word in the line marked --->.
	
	  2. Type  d2w  to delete the two UPPER CASE words.
	
	  3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 with a different count to delete the consecutive
	     UPPER CASE words with one command.
	
	--->  this ABC DE line FGHI JK LMN OP of words is Q RS TUV cleaned up.
	
	
	
	
	
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
				 Lesson 2.6: OPERATING ON LINES
	
	
			   ** Type  dd   to delete a whole line. **
	
	  Due to the frequency of whole line deletion, the designers of Vi decided
	  it would be easier to simply type two d's to delete a line.
	
	  1. Move the cursor to the second line in the phrase below.
	  2. Type  dd  to delete the line.
	  3. Now move to the fourth line.
	  4. Type   2dd   to delete two lines.
	
	--->  1)  Roses are red,
	--->  2)  Mud is fun,
	--->  3)  Violets are blue,
	--->  4)  I have a car,
	--->  5)  Clocks tell time,
